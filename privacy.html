        <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
        <p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR: </strong>The following provides an overview of the legal bases
            of
            the
            GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the regulations of
            the
            GDPR,
            national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence. If more specific legal
            bases
            are
            applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1) Sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent
                to
                the
                processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1) Sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for
                the
                purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that the
                interests
                or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that require the protection of personal data do
                not
                override.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection
            regulations
            of
            the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Federal
            Data
            Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions on the right of access, the right to deletion,
            the
            right
            to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and the
            transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore,
            state
            data
            protection laws of individual federal states may apply.</p>
        <p><strong>Notice on the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss DSG: </strong>These data protection notices serve
            both
            for
            information under the Swiss DSG and under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we
            ask
            you
            to note that, due to the broader territorial scope and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In
            particular, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data," "overriding interest," and "sensitive
            personal
            data" used in the Swiss DSG, the terms "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and "special
            categories of data" used in the GDPR are used. The legal meaning of the terms, however, remains determined
            by
            the
            Swiss DSG within its scope of application.</p>

        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements,
            considering
            the
            state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing,
            as
            well
            as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure
            a
            level
            of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
        <p>The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
            controlling
            physical and electronic access to the data as well as the related access, input, transmission, availability,
            and
            separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights,
            deletion of
            data, and response to data threats. We also consider the protection of personal data already during the
            development
            or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, according to the principle of data protection through
            technology
            design and data protection-friendly default settings.</p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it happens that these data are transferred to other
            entities,
            companies, legally independent organizational units, or persons, or are disclosed to them. Recipients of
            these
            data
            may include, for example, service providers tasked with IT tasks or providers of services and content
            integrated
            into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and conclude, in particular,
            corresponding
            contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>

        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union
            (EU),
            the
            European Economic Area (EEA)), or if processing occurs in the context of the use of services of third
            parties or
            the
            disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities, or companies, this only happens in accordance
            with
            the
            legal requirements. Provided the data protection level in the third country has been recognized by an
            adequacy
            decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers only occur if
            the
            data protection level is otherwise ensured, especially through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2) lit.
            c)
            GDPR), explicit consent, or in the case of contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49(1) GDPR).
            Additionally,
            we inform you of the bases for third-country transfers with the individual providers from the third country,
            with
            the adequacy decisions being primarily applicable. Information on third-country transfers and existing
            adequacy
            decisions can be found on the EU Commission's website: <a
                href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de"
                target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de</a>.
        </p>
        <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: As part of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU
            Commission has also recognized the data protection level for certain companies from the USA as secure by
            adequacy
            decision dated 07/10/2023. The list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can be
            found on
            the
            US Department of Commerce's website at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/"
                target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a> (in English). We inform you in our privacy
            notices
            which service providers we use that are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.</p>

            <title>Data Protection Information</title>
        </head>

        <body>

            <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying
                consents
                are revoked or there are no further legal grounds for processing. This applies to cases where the
                original
                processing purpose ceases to apply or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist when
                legal
                obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>

            <p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary for
                legal
                prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.</p>

            <p>Our data protection notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data that
                apply
                specifically to certain processing processes.</p>

            <p>In the case of multiple retention or deletion periods for a date, the longest period always applies.</p>

            <p>If a period does not explicitly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically
                starts
                at
                the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual
                relationships under which data is stored, the triggering event is the date the termination becomes
                effective
                or
                any other termination of the legal relationship.</p>

            <p>Data that is no longer required for the originally intended purpose but is retained due to legal
                requirements
                or
                other reasons is processed exclusively for the reasons justifying its retention.</p>

            <h2 id="m10">Rights of the Data Subjects</h2>
            <p>Rights of the data subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject, you have various rights under the GDPR,
                which
                are
                particularly derived from Articles 15 to 21 GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your

                        (f)

                        for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of
                        personal
                        data concerning you for such marketing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to
                        such
                        direct marketing.</strong></li>

                    data
                    concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the data and information
                    as
                    per
                    the legal provisions, including a copy of the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request the completion of incomplete
                    data
                    or
                    the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you, in accordance with the law.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Erasure and Restriction of Processing:</strong> You have the right to request the

                    form
                    of so-called "server log files". The server log files can include the address and name of the

                    web
                    pages and files, date and time of access, transmitted data volumes, reports on successful retrieval,

                    rule,
                    IP addresses and the requesting provider. Server log files can be used for security purposes, for
                    example,
                    to prevent server overload (especially in case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks), and to
                    ensure
                    server stability and load. <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
                    <strong>Deletion of Data:</strong> Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then
                    deleted
                    or anonymized. Data required for evidential purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective
                    incident is finally clarified.

            <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files or other storage markers that store information on end devices and read them
                from
                there. For example, to store the log-in status in a user account, a shopping cart content in an e-shop,
                the
                accessed content, or used functions of an online offer. Cookies can also be used for various purposes,
                such
                as
                ensuring the functionality, security, and comfort of online offers and creating analyses of visitor
                flows.

            <p><strong>Notes on Consent:&nbsp;</strong>We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore,
                we
                obtain prior consent from users unless it is not required by law. Consent is especially not necessary if
                storing
                and accessing the information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary to provide users with a
                telemedia
                service they explicitly request (i.e., our online offer). The revocable consent is clearly communicated
                to
                them
                and includes information on the respective cookie use.</p>

            <p><strong>Notes on Data Protection Legal Bases:&nbsp;</strong>The legal basis on which we process the
                personal
                data
                of users using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis
                for
                processing their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies is based on
                our
                legitimate interests (e.g., in the economical operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if
                required, to fulfill our contractual obligations, when the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our
                contractual obligations. We explain for what purposes the cookies are used in this privacy policy or in

                <li><strong>Processing of Cookie Data Based on Consent: </strong>We use a consent management solution to
                    obtain
                    users' consent for the use of cookies or the procedures and providers mentioned within the consent
                    management solution. This process is used to obtain, record, manage, and revoke consents,
                    particularly
                    related to the use of cookies and similar technologies that store, read, and process information on
                    users'
                    devices. As part of this process, users' consents for the use of cookies and the associated
                    processing
                    of
                    information, including specific processing and providers mentioned in the consent management
                    procedure,
                    are
                    obtained. Users also have the option to manage and revoke their consents. The consent declarations
                    are
                    stored to avoid repeated requests and to be able to provide proof of consent according to legal
                    requirements. The storage is server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie) or using
                    similar
                    technologies to be able to assign the consent to a specific user or their device. Unless specific
                    information about the providers of consent management services is available, the following general
                    notes
                    apply: The duration of the consent storage is up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is
                    created,
                    which is stored together with the time of consent, details of the scope of consent (e.g., relevant
                    categories of cookies and/or service providers), and information about the browser, system, and used
                    device;
